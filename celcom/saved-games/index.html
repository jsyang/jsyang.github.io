<p>Celestial Combat is a game large in ambition and scope. Battles
often span multiple solar systems with hundreds of spacecraft and
planets with caches of materials for war production.</p>
<p>As the gameplay solidified, finding a way to persist player progress grew more important.
Saving score and progress within a battle means players are likely to come back to the game.</p>
<h2 id="serialization">Serialization</h2>
<p>At the heart of saved games is a computer science concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization"><em>serialization</em></a>.
When you serialize the state of a program, you are turning the things represented in
memory into a <em>series of bytes</em>. They can be a certain format: e.g. JSON or a predefined
binary structure.</p>
<p>The <a href="entity-component-system.md">ECS</a> architecture of Celestial Combat makes serialization easy.
Game entities are all very basic classes that inherit a set of
properties such as position (x,y) and a <code>type</code> field from the <code>LivingEntity</code> base class,
then add their own properties to them, mostly fields relating to Components within the ECS pattern.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these can be serialized via <code>JSON.stringify(...)</code> but what about
fields that serve as references to other game entities? For instance, a planet that is
occupied by a faction has references to its planetary structures:</p>
<pre><code>class Planet extends LivingEntity {

    // Simple serialization
    canOrbitStar      = true;
    canStoreMaterial  = true;
    materialsRaw      = 0;
    materialsFinished = 0;
    hp                = 2000;
    mass              = 180;

    ...

    // JSON.stringify(planetInstance) will fail here
    star?: Star;
    pbase?: PBase;
    plab?: PLab;
    pcolony?: PColony;
    pcomm?: PComm;
    spacedock?: SpaceDock;
    sensorarray?: SensorArray;
    spaceport?: SpacePort;
    
    ...
}
</code></pre><p>Handling references was not immediately straightforward and to implement
saving games, we would need to solve this problem and preserve those references somehow.</p>
<h3 id="creation-ids">Creation IDs</h3>
<p>If we can recognize that a game state is essentially an instance of a relational database,
then we have a simple solution for this: use auto-incrementing primary keys or IDs to uniquely
map references from one entity to another. In Celestial Combat, an ID is a number.</p>
<p>These changes were done in a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Within the <code>create()</code> of <code>src/client/Entity/index.ts</code>, we need to assign an ID field
that is auto-incrementing. Its value is not mutated during the course of the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This field needs to be set to a specific value when loading (deserializing) a saved game. Make it
auto-increment by default or have it take a <code>creationId</code> just like any other field during the <code>create()</code> call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Components (as part of ECS) adds specific references to other entities to implement its
behavior. <code>const F_</code> inside <code>src/client/GameState/getEntityProperties.ts</code> defines a serialization map
for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entities are made up of Components. So map an entire Entity to a set of such Components.
<code>const FIELDS_BY_ENTITY</code> in <code>src/client/GameState/getEntityProperties.ts</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deserialization">Deserialization</h2>
<p>Once serialized, the game will need some way of recreating those references when loading a saved game.
The game can do this in 2 passes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deserialize the saved game data into an intermediate game state. All entities are created and have their
non-reference fields filled in. Reference fields are not yet linked and remain represented as numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflate the references. From a collection of all entities, find by ID and set the values of the
reference fields: numbers are mapped to entity instances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>function inflateReferencesForEntity(entity, index, allEntities) {
    Object.keys(entity)
        .forEach(prop =&gt; {
            const value = entity[prop];

            if (PROPERTY_IS_REFERENCE.test(prop) &amp;&amp; !isNaN(value)) {
                entity[prop] = allEntities.find(e =&gt; e._creationId === value);
            }
        });
}

function deserialize(json: string): void {
    const all         = JSON.parse(json);
    let maxCreationId = 0;

    Entity.clearAll();

    // First pass, create all the entities, leaving references as numbers
    all.forEach(e =&gt; {
        Entity.create(e.type, e);

        if (maxCreationId &lt; e._creationId) {
            maxCreationId = e._creationId;
        }
    });

    ...

    // Second pass, inflate references
    Entity.getAll().forEach(inflateReferencesForEntity);
    
    ...
}

</code></pre><h2 id="saved-game-storage">Saved game storage</h2>
<p>Currently, Celestial Combat stores only supports storing a single saved game
as compressed JSON in localStorage. It uses the <code>lz-string</code> compression package
because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is pure JS</li>
<li>has no dependencies of its own</li>
<li>is space-efficient (meant for use with localStorage)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we also want to save other info about a game session, not just entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>rank</li>
<li>score</li>
<li>number of consecutive wins / losses (for game over)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are easily handled by <code>JSON.stringify()</code> and <code>JSON.parse()</code> and stored in the same
manner. Each being assigned its own localStorage key.</p>
<p>You can find the all source code for saving / loading games under
<code>src/client/GameState</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Getting a Brompton brought me into whole new level of cycling. When I first got Bessie (<em>the Brompton</em>), the first thing
I noticed was how little bike there was compared to how fast it could pick up speed. It was the next best
thing to having a personal jetpack.</p>
<p>You see less of the bike in the cockpit.
You feel less of the bike because a Brompton&rsquo;s center of mass is lower,
and you accelerate much much faster owing to the interplay between its smaller wheel size (16&quot; x 3/8&quot;) and a higher gear ratio.</p>
<p>That nimble character lent gave me the feeling that I&rsquo;d just relearned how to cycle again.</p>
<p>As time goes by, the ride becomes more familiar and the rider more knowledgeable about some of the variables
of the experience. Upgrading is a means to introduce new variables to keep the sport or lifestyle interesting
and to extend the traits of the bike that matter the most to the rider and the kind of riding done.</p>
<p>Quite some fistfuls of hard earned cash have been sunk into upgrades purely on the bike itself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s common knowledge that drag force increases as speed increases. The most effective way to negate these effects are to wear clothing that induces the least amount of drag due to wind resistance.</p>

      <description>A bit of history Franklin Bookman devices were early eBook readers with plug in ROM cards that distributed (mostly) reference content. Later iterations could read user-written memory cards containing licensed content. These models often came with a &amp;ldquo;connectivity kit&amp;rdquo; that included
 a serial / USB data transfer cable a 2MB / 4MB read-write memory card a CD-ROM with the Bookman Desktop Manager software üíø  ‚òùÔ∏è Contents of this are of great interest    Example of a CD with a key code sticker DRM scheme Installing the Bookman Desktop Manager (BDM) requires the entry of a valid CD key.</description>

      <description>Ever since we visited the National Videogame Museum, my wife and I got more and more into Guitar Hero style rhythm games. Late last year, I did some research and found a great open source project called Clone Hero which aims to vastly improve upon games of this genre.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used rim plugs (&amp;ldquo;Veloplug&amp;rdquo; is a brand of rim plug) in 3 separate bike builds and they have been worthwhile as a rim tape / strip alternative.
Essentially, rim plugs are drawing pin sized bits of plastic that have a tub instead of a solid rod which you insert into the spoke holes from the inside of the wheel.</description>

      <description>Broken LED lights 2 years ago I bought two inexpensive LED bike lights which both ended up broken after some use. Since they were cheap but contained some salvageable parts I disassembled them to see what was wrong: power leads to the Li-ion cells had disconnected owing to a shoddy soldering job at the factory.</description>

      <description>My daughter is approaching the 6 month mark. This is a time when kids start to develop gross motor skills and begin to express themselves through play. In anticipation, I jumped at the chance to make some dynamic toys for her in addition to the mostly rigid ones she&amp;rsquo;s collected so far.
  Ended up doing a Friday late night build. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a collection of sounds ready, I just dumped all the sound effects from the DOS game Blood as a test.</description>

Background About a week ago I was having a look at some new input devices to use for my game experiments that were a little more interesting than a simple USB or Bluetooth Gamepad.</description>

      <title>Cheap Bike Bell Modification</title>

      <description>Having bought a bell similar to this one quite a while back for roughly (5 GBP), I&amp;rsquo;d seen how well it worked very loudly and clearly as a bell. Unfortunately, using the bell as a handlebar attachment is less than stellar due to its flawed strap design:
The steel strap which comes with it, leaves a large gap and owing to that, the bell has a tendency to spin around when you hit the slightest of bumps.</description>

      <description>Over the summer of 2013 several very well made corrugated plastic boats were featured on DIY sites and on r/buildaboat. It all seemed very simple to do and I&amp;rsquo;d always wanted my own boat to fool around with so I thought why not!</description>

<p>My daughter is approaching the 6 month mark. This is a time when
kids start to develop gross motor skills and begin to express
themselves through play. In anticipation, I jumped at the chance
to make some dynamic toys for her in addition to the mostly
rigid ones she&rsquo;s collected so far.</p>

<p>Ended up doing a Friday late night build. Since I didn&rsquo;t have a
collection of sounds ready, I just dumped all the sound effects
from the DOS game Blood as a test.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>A few items were at my disposal for this project:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 x Raspberry Pi model B+</li>
<li>1 x JBL Clip with an aged battery (3.7v 600mAh)</li>
<li>1 x cheap USB numpad</li>
<li>1 x microUSB power pack &ndash; free conference knick-knack</li>
<li>1 x 2GB microSD card</li>
<li>1 x Chinese green tea tin</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary component for this sound tin is the JBL Clip. After all,
you can&rsquo;t hear anything without a decent speaker! Disassembling it
revealed a PCB with a footprint just the right size to fit on the floor
of the tin.</p>

<p>A few holes drilled in a hexagonal pattern on one side of the tin serve
as the speaker grill. The JBL Clip battery was losing capacity due to age
 but is still functional.</p>

<p><img src="/images/random-sound-tin/sound-tin.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After the guts of the JBL Clip were mounted inside, the USB numpad needed
a similar treatment; the only difference was that the keys were mounted on
the outside.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The SD card was loaded with the latest version of Raspbian Lite, leaving
a little over 600MB free for sound files and everything else. I turned on
console auto-login via <code>raspi-config</code> and created two bash scripts:</p>

<h4 id="1-playrandom-sh">1. <code>playRandom.sh</code></h4>

<p>Used to randomly select a single <code>WAV</code> file within a folder and play it back with <code>aplay</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/sh

ls *.wav |sort -R |tail -$N |while read file; do
    aplay $file
    exit 0
done
</code></pre>

<h4 id="2-randomsoundplayer-sh">2. <code>randomSoundPlayer.sh</code></h4>

<p>Used to continuously listen for key presses so it can either execute <code>playRandom.sh</code>
or quit to the shell.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/sh

echo Press Q to exit, any other key to play a random sound

while true; do
    read -t 0.3 -N 1 input
    if [[ $input = &quot;q&quot; ]] || [[ $input = &quot;Q&quot; ]]; then
        echo
        break
    elif [[ -n $input ]]; then
        ./sfx/playRandom.sh &amp;
    fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>All that was needed to finish this was to add
a line at the end of <code>~/.bash_profile</code> to run
<code>randomSoundPlayer.sh</code> on login. This ensures the final step of
any boot sequence on the device will start the sound player loop.</p>

<h2 id="getting-sounds">Getting sounds</h2>

<p>There are lots of nice sound libraries and sound effects banks on the internet, but one
particularly good example was &ldquo;soundsnap.com&rdquo;. I chose this one since it had an exceptionally
simple filtering and searching mechanism (e.g. search all sounds for &ldquo;animal&rdquo; tag and duration of &lt; 2 seconds).</p>

<p>Needed a few other pieces of glue code to turn this site into an easy to download source of sound effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>puppeteer (headless Chromium API)</li>
<li>ffmpeg (optionally convert MP3 into PCM-WAV)</li>
<li>ffmpeg-normalize (normalize audio loudness)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve put all the code together for this into a <a href="https://github.com/jsyang/soundscraper">soundscraper</a>.
Just follow the readme instructions and you should have some scraped sounds for personal use in no time.</p>

<h4 id="normalizing-the-audio-loudness">Normalizing the audio loudness</h4>

<p>The downloaded sound files can be all over the place in terms of loudness. To ensure
sounds are never too quite nor too loud, we have to <em>normalize</em> them: for this,
I&rsquo;ve selected the <a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/loudness">EBU R128 normalization preset</a> in <code>ffmpeg</code>. This is a broadcasting
standard norm that should be good enough for our purposes.</p>

<p>Using <code>yarn normalize</code>, we can run an <code>ffmpeg-normalize</code> in batch mode to convert
all our non-normalized MP3s into MP2s. They end up in a <code>mp3/normalized</code> folder within our
tool.</p>

## Distraction free writing setup


So I had to add these settings in ~/.vimrc in order to make VIM behave as it would usually in MacOS:

```
set term=$TERM
set nocompatible
```

then restarted the terminal emulator (jackpal.androidterm)

Setup is:
- Syncthing (com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)
- Editor (org.billthefarmer.editor)
- ConnectBot (org.connectbot)
- Terminal Emulator (jackpal.androidterm)

I also uninstalled all Google related apps and disabled / reverted them to
their factory defaults:

- GMail
- Google Play Services
- Google Play Store
- Google Maps
- Phone Dialer
- For all other unused system apps I've denied all permissions
  - This cuts down on any kind of load on the phone and silences network
    traffic
  - The phone is much snappier now

Also had to set the default shell to `/system/xbin/bash -i` and the HOME
directory (i.e. `~`) to `/sdcard/` and add a `.bashrc` which starts us off in
the home directory:

```
cd ~
```

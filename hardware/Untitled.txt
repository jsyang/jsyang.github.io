## Distraction free writing setup


So I had to add these settings in ~/.vimrc in order to make VIM behave as it would usually in MacOS:

```
set term=$TERM
set nocompatible
```

then restarted the terminal emulator (jackpal.androidterm)

## Apps installed

- Syncthing (com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)
  Wifi, location based automatic syncing

- Editor (org.billthefarmer.editor)
  Simple text editor with auto-save

- ConnectBot (org.connectbot)
  For quickly accessing hosts via SSH

- Terminal Emulator (jackpal.androidterm)
  What every programmer needs

- https://github.com/EXALAB/AxGit (for Android `git` CLI executable)

I also uninstalled all Google related apps and disabled / reverted them to
their factory defaults:

- GMail
- Google Play Services
- Google Play Store
- Google Maps
- Phone Dialer
- For all other unused system apps I've denied all permissions
  - This cuts down on any kind of load on the phone and silences network
    traffic
  - The phone is much snappier now

Also had to set the default shell to `/system/xbin/bash -i` and the HOME
directory (i.e. `~`) to `/sdcard/` and add a `.bashrc` which starts us off in
the home directory:

```
cd ~
```

## Git installation

If you have Bash set as your shell, just edit your `~/.bashrc` file to include the PATH addition as per the installation
app.

You will need to either give all users permission to execute the `git` file or move the directory to where your usual user
in Android has permission. Usually this is `/sdcard/`.

If you want to go the `root` user way, just do
```
su
# Replace this path with wherever the installer placed them
cd /data/user/0/exa.free.ag/files
chmod +rx *
```

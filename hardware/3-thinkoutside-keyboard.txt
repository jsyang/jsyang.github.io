this is a note that I've written on the new keyboard
It is a very good keyboard, just needs some getting used to.
The Q key is a little stuck if you hit it in the wrong spot, but otherwise
it looks alright.

I had to glue the hinge plates as well. I think there was a material weakness
near the battery cover that stressed a really thin part of the frame when
new batteries are inserted. Not affecting anything functionally.

Cheers!

Some of the punctuation marks take a bit of getting used to
if you're coming from using a normal laptop or full sized keyboard.
I think this is pretty good though.

Palm 3245WW Wireless Keyboard also similar, it has the "palmOne" era logo instead of the other logos on it
Essentially the same design.

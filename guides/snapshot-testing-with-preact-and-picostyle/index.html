<h3 id="snapshot-testing-with-preact-and-picostyle">Snapshot testing with Preact and Picostyle</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not immediately obvious how to test Preact JSX within a Jest snapshot test, especially
when they are styled with Picostyle. However, the great thing about micro-libraries is
the minimal length of their source code. We can dig into them to see
what missing links they might need in order to do what we want to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Preact needs a render to string wrapper for snapshots: <code>preact-render-to-string</code> works fine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picostyle appends a stylesheet to the virtual DOM (VDOM) while generating CSS class names:
to get the CSS rules we just need to read them back out from the VDOM.
This can only be done in sequence (after the <code>render()</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>expect(render(renderable)).toMatchSnapshot();
expect(getCSSRules()).toMatchSnapshot('css');
</code></pre><p>A Jest helper lives inside the setup file for the CSS rules: <code>getCSSRules()</code></p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/jsyang/fresh/commit/adb778d3a4ac0d319d880af89b997752de52c98d#diff-898d36809543307c565081762664faf8"><code>src/client/components/AdminScreen/TableRow.spec.tsx</code></a> for a full example.</p>

                <p>A coding font called <a href="https://dank.sh">Dank Mono</a> showed up in my programming feed recently.
As someone who is always looking for ways to improve my coding environment, changing the
default IDE font seemed like something worth investigating.</p>
<p><img src="/images/try-before-you-buy-fonts/dankmono-sample.png" alt="dankmono-sample"></p>
<p>I was pretty happy with <a href="https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka">Iosevka</a> already but was curious to
see if Dank Mono was worth the social media hype; setting it as the IDE font would be the best way to
judge its merits. The landing page had a live-text sample of the font, though the designer wanted £40
for a license to use it!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t condone piracy especially with regards to independent artists and creators; if the font met my
needs I was prepared to pay to use it! Nonetheless, this is what I did to get a usable font file
extracted out of the landing page to use in my IDE:</p>
<h2 id="convert-a-woff-font-to-macos-native-font">Convert a WOFF font to macOS native font</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the WOFF file from the site by inspecting the Network tab inside DevTools and filtering for &ldquo;font&rdquo; requests.
In this case, the font is given as a base64 string: right click the request and then click on &ldquo;Open in new tab&rdquo; to download
the response as a file.
<br>
<img src="/images/try-before-you-buy-fonts/download-woff.png" alt="download woff"><br><br></li>
<li>Convert the WOFF file to an OTF or TTF file with <a href="%E2%80%A8https://andrewsun.com/tools/woffer-woff-font-converter">any online converter</a>
(e.g. Google &ldquo;woff to ttf&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://birdfont.org">BirdFont</a>, a font editor. We&rsquo;ll use this to assemble the glyphs (characters) into
a font file.</li>
<li>Open BirdFont and ensure the name and description of the font are valid (this usually trips up macOS when importing into Font Book). <br>
<img src="/images/try-before-you-buy-fonts/birdfont.png" alt="birdfont"><br><br>
<img src="/images/try-before-you-buy-fonts/birdfont2.png" alt="birdfont"><br><br></li>
<li>Save the font project as a .bf (BirdFont project file) </li>
<li>Export the font to a folder via menu and one of the exported TTF files should install correctly via OSX Font Book. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="visual-trial">Visual trial</h2>
<p><img src="/images/try-before-you-buy-fonts/trial.png" alt="trial"></p>
<p>Seeing the jarring lowercase &ldquo;f&rdquo; and lack of distinction between <code>(){}[]</code> at
smaller sizes live inside the IDE, my decision was that this font
wasn&rsquo;t any better than Isoevka.</p>

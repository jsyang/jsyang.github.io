<p>These cheap bluetooth gamepads are often branded and sold as remote shutter buttons
for smartphones. I think their best purpose is actually to be used as gamepads, especially
for mobile devices and bluetooth-enabled PCs. They can be routinely found on either eBay or
Amazon for around $3 or 5 GBP, shipping included. This makes them one of the best value bluetooth input devices
on the market as of 2018.</p>
<p>Depending on the seller, the gamepads can be found under different branding, though functionally
they are all the same device. What you get is a bluetooth controller with an analog stick, 4 buttons, and
a micro-USB port for charging its built-in LiPo battery (manufacturer claim: 20 hours of usage).</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the cheaper listings are just as good as the listings from sellers that try to mark up the price of the device;
usually $12 or Â£8.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Holding the <code>I/O</code> button for 3 seconds will power the device on/off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>GAME &lt;--&gt; KEY</code> toggle will work differently depending on what device it&rsquo;s paired with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On OSX, the <code>GAME</code> mode, the analog stick will send movement control keystrokes along with some characters for each
direction (up, down, left, right).<br><br>
<code>iOS</code> seems to send &ldquo;yt&rdquo;<br><br>
<code>triangle</code> sends &ldquo;jn&rdquo;<br><br>
<code>a</code> sends &ldquo;uf&rdquo;<br><br>
<code>x</code> sends &ldquo;hr&rdquo;<br><br>
<strong>This mode is good to use for game keymappings.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On OSX, the <code>KEY</code> mode, the analog stick won&rsquo;t send anything to a textfield.<br><br>
<code>iOS</code> seems to send Volume Up<br><br>
<code>x</code> sends Volume Down<br><br>
<code>triangle</code> doesn&rsquo;t send anything<br><br>
<code>a</code> sends Mute Volume<br><br>
<strong>This mode appears to be used for media control.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mtk-and-android-modes">MTK and Android Modes</h2>
<p>You can set the controller to emit different kinds of input by putting it
in either &ldquo;MTK&rdquo; or &ldquo;Android&rdquo; mode. Start by powerin off the controller.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Holding down the <code>triangle button</code> + <code>power button</code> will set it to MTK mode (red LED, when powered on in this mode)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding down the <code>a button</code> + <code>power button</code> will set it to Android mode (blue LED, when powered on in this mode)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I use the MTK mode when paired with OSX to play games in OpenEmu.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-with-openemu">Compatibility with OpenEmu</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve manage to use these controllers (in GAME mode) with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API">HTML5 GamePad API</a>
as well as for GameBoy and NES (Famicom) emulation with <a href="http://openemu.org">OpenEmu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re attempting to use OpenEmu, ensure you have closed Chrome as leaving Chrome running is known
to <a href="https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/issues/798#issuecomment-31160017">capture input states based on how it implements the HTML Gamepad API</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Initially, the controller may register in your Bluetooth listing with its MAC address. Once paired, these are typical
device names:</p>

<h2 id="celestial-combat">Celestial Combat</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to write a game that fully supports this type of gamepad, which
makes it perfectly serviceable for mobile game play: <a href="/games/celcom">Celestial Combat</a>.</p>

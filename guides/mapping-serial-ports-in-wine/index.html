                <p>If you need to use serial ports created by Serial-to-USB (S2U) adaptors in MacOS with your Windows apps running in Wine, you&rsquo;ll need to map them so that Wine can correctly detect and use them. For the Wine version of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/franklin-bookman-desktop-manager-1.3">Bookman Desktop Manager 1.3</a>, I needed to map the port it used to <code>COM1</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug all of your S2U adapters to begin</li>
<li>Run <code>ls /dev/tty.usb*</code> to list all of the devices pre-existing for your machine</li>
<li>Plug in the S2U device you intend to use with Wine and then run the command from #2</li>
<li>Find the new entry in the list, ex: <code>/dev/tty.usbserial-1410</code></li>
<li>Find the Wineskin / Winery / CrossOver <code>.app</code> file. This is the wrapper around your Windows app.</li>
<li>Right click on the <code>.app</code> file and select &ldquo;Show Package Contents&rdquo;; the wrapper is actually a directory.</li>
<li>Then proceed into <code>Contents/Resources</code>. There is a <code>dosdevices</code> directory here that exposes all files (including device files, such as the COM port) which Wine can access during a run of the Windows program</li>
<li>Open a terminal window and type <code>cd </code> then drag the <code>dosdevices</code> directory from the Finder window into the terminal to get the full path. Hit Enter to go into that directory.</li>
<li>If you type <code>pwd</code> into the terminal you should now see the full path of the <code>dosdevices</code> directory.</li>
<li>Run <code>ln -s MACOS_DEV_TTY com1</code>, replacing <code>MACOS_DEV_TTY</code> with the result from #4; ex: <code>ln -s /dev/tty.usbserial-1410 com1</code>. This creates a symbolic link file inside <code>dosdevices</code> which maps the device file from MacOS to Wine.</li>
<li>Run your Wine app as normal, you should now be able to select COM1 in your app and use the serial port.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for the BDM3.1 app I was using, that now worked perfectly on MacOS through this mapping procedure and spared me the experience of relying on Windows. A great success!</p>
